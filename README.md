**Dots2Line** is a mobile app that simulates the learning process of neural networks. There are 2 main types of learning available: regression and classification. The user creates it's own dataset on a grid, sets the hyperparameters and runs the learning process. 

Depending on the performance of your device, it is recommended to adjust the network structure: decrease number of units per hidden layer and number of hidden layers, even setting ReLU as activation function in rare situations.
